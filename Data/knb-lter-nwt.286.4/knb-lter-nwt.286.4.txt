    Anthropogenic climate change is altering interactions among numerous
    species, including plants and pollinators. Plant-pollinator
    interactions, crucial for the persistence of most plant and many
    insect species, are threatened by climate change-driven phenological
    shifts. Phenological mismatches between plants and their pollinators
    may affect pollination services, and simulations indicated that
    these mismatches may reduce floral resources available to up to 50%
    of insect pollinator species. Although alpine plants rely heavily on
    vegetative reproduction, seedling recruitment and seed dispersal are
    likely to be important drivers of alpine community structure.
    Similarly, advanced flowering may expose plants to increased risk of
    frost damage and shifted soil moisture regimes; phenologically
    advanced plants will experience these environmental factors
    differently, which may alter their floral resource production. These
    effects may be dependent upon topography. Some species of alpine
    plants on the Niwot Ridge have displayed advanced phenology under
    treatments of advanced snowmelt (Forrester, 2021). However, little
    is understood about how these differences in distribution and
    phenology affect pollinator community composition and plant
    fecundity. Here we strive to examine how experimentally-induced
    changes in the timing of flowering and number of flowers produced by
    plants impact plant-pollinator interactions and seed set. We also
    ask how topography and the number of flowers interact with early
    snowmelt to affect pollination rates and the diversity of
    pollinating insects. Finally, we ask how seed set of Geum rossii is
    affected by pollinator visitation at different times of the season,
    under experimentally advanced snowmelt versus unmanipulated
    snowmelt, and with visitation by different insect taxa. In summer
    2020, we found that plots with advanced phenology experienced peaks
    in pollinator visitation rates and pollinator diversity earlier than
    plots with unmanipulated snowmelt. We expect this to be because of
    the advanced floral phenology of certain key species in these plots.

    The Black Sand Extended Growing Season Length Experiment consists of
    five sites on Niwot Ridge, each with a pair of 10 x 40 m plots.
    Snowmelt was accelerated in one plot at each site by spreading 567g
    m^-2 of chemically inert black sand on the snow surface in the
    spring. The second plot at each site was kept as an unmanipulated
    snowmelt control to which the same amount of black sand was added
    after ambient snow melt in the summer.
  
               
    In 2018, black sand was applied to the early snowmelt plots at: East
    Knoll, Audubon and Lefty = May 7, 2018. Trough = May 8, 2018. Black
    sand was applied to all control plots on July 16, 2018.
  
               
    In 2019, black sand was applied to the early snowmelt plots at: East
    Knoll May 23, 2019; Audubon, Lefty and Trough June 3, 2019. Black
    sand was applied to control plots at: East Knoll, Lefty and Trough
    on August 19, 2019; Audubon on August 21, 2019.
  
               
    In 2020, black sand was applied to the early snowmelt plots at: East
    Knoll on May 12, 2020; Audubon, Lefty, and Trough on May 18, 2020.
    Black sand was applied to control plots at: East Knoll on August 3,
    2020; Audubon and Lefty on August 17, 2020; Trough on August 22-23,
    2020.
  
               
    To determine if pollinator visitation rate, species richness, and
    composition differ between early snowmelt and control plants, we
    performed pollinator observations of all flowering plants in
    phenologically advanced and control plots in 2020. We performed
    observations within five to six 1 m^2 or 2 m^2 subplots per
    treatment at four sites: Audubon, East Knoll, Lefty, and Trough. We
    observed subplots for 15 minutes per observation period. We began
    observations when flowering began in each plot, then observed plots
    approximately twice weekly until floral senescence of plants in
    plots.
  
               
    To quantify weather variables that could affect pollinating insect
    behavior, we collected temperature, windspeed, and relative humidity
    at each observation period. To quantify broad floral abundance and
    diversity landscape, we counted the total number of flowers of each
    species per site and per treatment block; to quantify local floral
    abundance and diversity I counted the total number of flowers per
    species in each subplot. To assess the topography of each subplot,
    which may also affect pollinator behavior directly and indirectly,
    we downloaded a digital elevation model (DEM) for Niwot Ridge from
    OpenTopography (Anderson 2013). Using the package raster and
    function terrain (Hijmans 2023), we calculated elevation, slope, and
    solar radiation. We also calculated topographic position index (TPI)
    at small and large scales (as in Oldfather et al. 2016).
  
               
    To investigate the direct and indirect effects of early snowmelt on
    plant reproduction, we performed a pollinator exclusion experiment
    using Geum rossii. In each treatment block at each of the four
    sites, we identified 30 flowering G. rossii individuals. We
    identified buds and divided the 30 plants into three categories:
    open pollinated, closed to pollinators, and hand pollinated. Open
    pollinated flowers were left open until just before seed set and
    closed flowers were closed to insects using mesh baggies from bud
    stage until seed collection. To perform hand pollination of the hand
    pollinated flowers, we transferred pollen collected from a G. rossii
    individual (from at least 10 m away from the target flower) to the
    receptive stigma of the focal individual—flowers were closed to
    insects using mesh baggies from bud stage until seed collection.
    This was repeated twice across the flowering period of G. rossii at
    each site and treatment. Finally, to elucidate the effect of
    different insect visitors on G. rossii seed set, we bagged 100 G.
    rossii buds at peak flowering at the site Trough, then removed bags
    from flowers one at a time to allow a visit from a single insect
    (recording the insect’s identity) and immediately replaced mesh
    bags. Seeds from both the pollinator exclusion and individual visit
    experiments were collected upon seed set.
