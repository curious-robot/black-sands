    The purpose of the Black Sand experiment is to measure treatment
    effects on date of snowmelt on Niwot Ridge. Five sites with paired
    plots (treatment and control) were implemented across Niwot as part
    of the extended summer research program in order to understand the
    effects of earlier snowmelt. This dataset contains measurements of
    snowdepth throughout the melt season, manual measurements of
    volumetric water content and temperature data as an indication of
    snowmelt timing.

    We accelerated snowmelt in one plot of each block by adding
    chemically inert black sand, while keeping the second plot as an
    unmanipulated control (black sand was added to these plots after
    snow had naturally melted). Five plots (each paired with treatment
    and control) were implemented, with each plot measuring 40 x 10 m in
    different locations. Snowmelt was accelerated in treatment plots
    using of 567g/ m2 black sand spread on the snow surface, control
    plots had the same amount of black sand applied after ambient
    snowmelt. To test the interactive effects of warming together with
    snowmelt, we established 3 control subplots per plot, and 3 subplots
    with passive ITEX warming chambers per plot (each site thus had 3
    control, 3 warming, 3 early snowmelt and 3 early snowmelt + warming
    subplots).
  
               
    Snow depth was measured ~3 times per week between sand application
    and snowmelt in both treatment and control plots. Measurements were
    taken in the same 5 spots for each observation using a snow probe.
  
               
    In 2018: Soil moisture was measured ~3 times per week between sand
    application and snowmelt in both treatment and control plots.
    Measurements were taken in the same 5 spots for each observation
    using a handheld probe with 4.5" prongs. These measurements of
    soil moisture were discontinued in 2019, when continuous
    measurements were begun.
  
               
    In 2020: We used a hand-held time domain reflectometry (TDR)
    FieldScout probe (Spectrum Technologies, Inc, IL, U.S.A.) on three
    different days in the late growing season (8/27, 9/1, 9/17) to take
    five measurements of volumetric water content of the soil in each of
    the 3 control and warming treatment subplots within each plot.
  
               
    In 2018-2020 snowmelt was recorded in each pair of control and
    warmed ITEX subplots (A,B, or C within Early and Control plots) by
    visual observations.
  
               
    To record snowmelt timing in 2021-2023 we put iButtons next to all
    eight 1 x 0.5 m subplots and all six 1 x 1 m ITEX subplots in each
    10 x 40 m plot. In September, iButtons were buried as shallowly as
    possible (~1 cm) beneath the soil surface.
  
               
    At all sites except Soddie, iButtons were placed in between adjacent
    warmed and control subplot pairs, so that the iButton indicated as
    being placed at ACWA is representative of both ACWA and ACCA.
    However, at the Soddie site, paired subplots are not immediately
    adjacent to each other. In 2021-2022, iButtons were placed next to
    all 12 ITEX subplots at Soddie. In 2022-2023 there only 4 iButtons
    for the six ITEX subplots in the Soddie Early Snowmelt plot, so
    iButtons were placed at SEWA, SECB, in between SECA/SEWB, and in
    between SEWC/SECC (labeled SEWC). ), iButtons were buried next to
    the right side of the subplot, looking uphill, as close to center as
    possible, except in a few subplots where it was not possible and
    they were buried along the left side instead. iButtons were
    retrieved as soon as possible after snowmelt the following field
    season.
  
               
    For 2021-2022, we could not find iButtons at subplots: AEWA, ECOS4,
    LCOS1, LCOS4, LCOS5, LCOS8 and TEWA. The iButton at TCOS8 was found
    but had been pulled up and was on the ground surface.
  
               
    For 2022-2023, data did not download from iButtons at ACOS2, ACOS6,
    LESS4, LESS5 and TCOS7. The iButtons at SECA/SEWB and SECB were not
    found.
  
               
    Relative locations of all vegetation subplots within plots were
    measured in the summer of 2022. Diagram of measurements are included
    as a pdf with this data package.
